# Web application for mountain rescue operations management.
Now it's simple but working prototype: https://mountainrescue.herokuapp.com/

I'm going to continuously develop application (add new features) while keeping code as clean as possible and open for further extensions.

# Features:
- CRUD: rescuers and operations.
- Rescuers get busy when involved in currently running operation.
- Can't involve rescuer in next operation when busy.
- Rescuers are released when their operation is finished.
- Custom validation (validating list of Rescuers in Operation objects)
- Security (roles, storing users in database, custom forms)
- Bootstrap views

# Technologies:
- Spring (Boot, MVC, Security)
- Hibernate
- MySQL
- Bootstrap

# TODO:
- further development
